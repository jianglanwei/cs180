            <b><a href= "https://davidpaulwei.github.io/cs180/proj1/">Project 1</a>
            : Colorizing the <i>Prokudin-Gorskii</i> Photo Collection<br></b>
            <i>Prokudin-Gorskii</i> photographed the Russian Empire using black-and-white negatives with red, green and blue filters,
            hoping future technologies could stack the three layers to produce colored image.
            I took the digitized negatives of <i>Prokudin-Gorskii</i>'s work to produce the RGB color image.
            The original three color layers from <i>Prokudin-Gorskii</i>'s work were not accurately aligned, 
            so I designed an alignment algorithm using <b>Image Pyramid</b> and <b>Edge Detection</b> to preprocess the layers before stacking them together.

            <b><a href= "https://davidpaulwei.github.io/cs180/proj2/">Project 2</a>
            : Fun with Filters and Frequencies<br></b>
            By applying filters and analyzing frequencies, images can be processed and combined in interesting ways.
            In the first part of this project, edge detection is conducted by applying the <b>Finite Difference Filter</b>. 
            <b>Gaussian Filter</b> is applied to get rid of the unnecessary wrinkles. 
            Then, images are sharpened by stacking its edges onto itself.
            The second part of this project consists of two image binding tasks. 
            The first task generates Hybrid Image by adding the high frequency of one image to the low frequency of another.
            Both successful and failing attempts are introduced.
            The second task blends images by applying the <b>Gaussian Stack</b> and the <b>Laplacian Stack</b>.

            <b><a href= "https://davidpaulwei.github.io/cs180/proj3/">Project 3</a>
            : Face Morphing and Modelling a Photo Collection<br></b>
            In the first part of this project, I morphed two face images using <b>Affine Transformation</b>.
            I obtained 100 correspondences for each of the two faces and computed their average coordinates.
            <b>Triangulation</b> was conducted on the correspondences and for each triangle, <b>Affine Matrixes</b> were generated to stretch the triangles from the original image to the Midway image.
            I used <b>Cross Dissolve</b> to bind the color. I furtherly generated a sequence of 51 morphed images using different <b>Morph Weight</b> to produce the morphing GIF.
            In the second part, I computed the mean face of 12 Brazilian faces, and stretched my face into the shape of the mean face.
            I also computed the mean face of 12 smiling Brazilian faces to add a smile on my grim portrait.

            <b><a href= "https://davidpaulwei.github.io/cs180/proj4/">Project 4</a>
            : Autostitching and Photo Mosaic<br></b>
            Project 4 consists two parts: <b>Image Warping and Mosaicing</b> 
            (Part A) and <b>Feature Matching for Autostitching</b> (Part B).<br>
            &emsp;In Part A, I rectified images using <b>Perspective Transform</b>. 
            I manually selected correspondences on the images, and warped them
            so that their transformed correspondences form a rectangle.
            I also produced <b>mosaics images</b> by blending pairs of images that 
            overlap with each other. First, I manually matched a few pixels that 
            represent the same corner of an object on the two images. Then, I 
            treated these pixel matches as correspondences, and warped the first 
            image so that after warping, the correspondences on the first image 
            aligns with the correspondences on the second images. In this way, 
            the same objects on the two images would match. Finally, I conducted 
            <b>Alpha Blend</b> on the output mosaic to erase the edge between the 
            two images.<br>
            &emsp;In Part B, I also produced mosaic images, 
            only this time instead of manually matching the pixels, the pixel 
            matches are automatically detected and selected.
            Corners serve as great symbols of objects on an image, so I used 
            <b>Harris Corner Detector</b> to find the corners on the images, and 
            treat them as interest points. Then, I used 
            <b>Adaptive Non-Maximal Suppression (ANMS)</b> to select a few interest 
            points that are not only high in "corner strength", but also as 
            uniformly distributed in the image as possible. They are the potential 
            correspondences. Later, I matched the potential correspondences using 
            <b>Feature Descriptors</b>. If the best match of a 
            potential correspondence did not score significantly higher than its 
            second-best match, I would abandon this pixel. The matched pixels
            still may contain error. I found the optimal set of matches using the 
            idea of <b>Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC)</b>. At last, 
            similar to Part A, I used the optimal matches to conduct perspective 
            transform on the first image so that it aligns with the second image, 
            and blended the overlapping region to erase the edge.

            <b><a href= "https://davidpaulwei.github.io/cs180/proj5/">Project 5</a>
            : Fun with Diffusion Models<br></b>    
            Project 5 consists two parts: <b>The power of Diffusion Models</b> 
            (Part A) and <b>Diffusion Models from Scratch</b> (Part B).<br>    
            &emsp; In Part A, I mainly played around with a pretrained diffusion model
            called <b>DeepFloyd IF</b>. First, I used the model to conduct
            <b>denoising</b>. I blurred a sample image using random noise, 
            and used the model to predict that noise. I also denoised the image using
            <b>Gaussian Blur</b> and compared the denoised results. Then, I denoised 
            a random noise image to obtain a computer-generated image. I adapted the
            <b>Classifier-Free Guidance</b> technic. Later, I conducted image-to-image 
            translation, where images are translated into similar images either based 
            on masks or text prompts. At last, I produced <b>Visual Anagrams</b>, 
            <b>Hybrid Images</b>, and a course logo.<br>    
            &emsp; In Part B, I built and trained a diffusion model from scratch. First, 
            I trained a UNet to denoise half-noisy <b>MNIST</b> images (original 
            image + 50% pure noise). Then, to denoise images with different
            amount of noise, I added <b>Time Conditioning</b> to the UNet, where the 
            UNet is told how noisy each images are. The trained UNet can accurately 
            predict the noise that had been added to the images. Using the 
            trained UNet denoiser, I generated MNIST-like images by denoising 
            pure noise in 300 steps, only to find the computer 
            generated images looks little like human-written numbers. To boost the 
            result, I added <b>Class Conditioning</b> to the UNet, where the UNet 
            is not only told how noisy the images are, but also the labels (0 to 9) 
            of the images. 10% of the images are not provided with a label. I adapted 
            <b>Classifier-Free Guidance</b> to generate MNIST-like images. The results
            are much better compared the previous attempt.
