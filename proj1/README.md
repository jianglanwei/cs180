_Prokudin-Gorskii_ photographed the Russian Empire using black-and-white negatives with red, green and blue filters, hoping future technologies could stack the three layers to produce colored image. I took the digitized negatives of _Prokudin-Gorskii_'s work to produce the RGB color image. The original three color layers from _Prokudin-Gorskii_'s work were not accurately aligned, so I designed an alignment algorithm using **Image Pyramid** and **Edge Detection** to preprocess the layers before stacking them together.
