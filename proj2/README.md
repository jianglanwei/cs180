By applying filters and analyzing frequencies, images can be processed and combined in interesting ways. In the first part of this project, edge detection is conducted by applying the **_Finite Difference Filter_**. _**Gaussian Filter**_ is applied to get rid of the unnecessary wrinkles. Then, images can be sharpened by stacking its edges onto itself. The second part of this project consists of two image binding tasks. The first task generates **Hybrid Image** by adding the high frequency of one image to the low frequency of another. Both successful and failing attempts are introduced.The second task **blends images** by applying the _**Gaussian Stack**_ and the _**Laplacian Stack**_.
