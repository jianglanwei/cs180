        1. Introduction
    </h3>
    <p>
        My final project consists two parts: <b>Fit a Neural Field to a 2D Image
        </b> (Part A), and <b>Fit a Neural Radiance Field from Multi-view Images
        </b> (Part B).
    </p>
    <p>
        In Part A, I built a <b>Multiplayer Perceptron (MLP) network</b> to fit 
        a single 2D image so that given any pixel's coordinate, the network can 
        predict the pixel's RGB color. When the image's shape is provided, the 
        network can <b>reconstruct the whole image</b>. 
    </p>
    <p>       
        In Part B, I trained a larger MLP network to serve as a <b>Neural Radiance 
        Field (NeRF)</b> and used it to fit a 3D <i>Lego</i> object through 
        inverse rendering from <b>multi-view calibrated images</b>. The pixels on 
        the images were bounded with rays represented in 3D world coordinate system. 
        Sample locations were gathered along the rays, and their volume rendering 
        results were used to fit the RGB colors on the images' pixels. In this 
        way the <i>Lego</i> object was modeled into the NeRF. Using the trained 
        NeRF, I'm able to predict the images of the <i>Lego</i> taken from <b>any
        given perspectives</b>. I rendered these images into a video to create a 
        rotating effect of the <i>Lego</i>.

    <h3>
        Part A: Fit a Neural Field to a 2D Image
    </h3>
    <p>
        In Part A, I trained a Neural Field to fit a single 2D image. This means
        that given any pixel's coordinate, the network can predict the pixels' 
        RGB color. When the image's shape is provided, the network can
        reconstruct the whole image.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to map 2D pixel coordinates to RGB colors, I built a <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron">Multilayer 
        Perceptron</a> (MLP) network defined as follows.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
        The Sinusoidal Positional Encoding (PE) is conducted to expand the 
        dimensionality of the input coordinates. Here the PE operation is defined
        as 
        \[
        PE(x) = \{x, sin(2^0\pi x), cos(2^0\pi x),
            sin(2^1\pi x), cos(2^1\pi x), ..., 
            sin(2^{L-1}\pi x), cos(2^{L-1}\pi x)\},
        \]
        where <i>L</i> is the highest frequency level.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is not feasible to train the network with all the pixels in each
        iteration due to the GPU memory limit, so I implemented a dataloader
        that randomly samples a batch size of <i>N</i> pixels at every iteration 
        of training. I normalized the pixel coordinates into [0, 1] before 
        feeding it to PE encoding.
    </p>
    <p>
        I trained my model on an animal image and the famous <i>Lenna</i> image
        shown in Figure 2.

    <p>
        The model is trained for 2,000 steps on both images, with each step 
        learning from a batch size of <i>N</i> = 10,000 pixels. I used the 
        Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 1e-2 for gradient descent.
        I set the hidden layer size in the MLP net as 256 neurons, and the highest 
        frequency level in PE encoding as <i>L</i> = 10, which would map a 2 
        dimension coordinate into a 42 dimension vector. I chose the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error">Mean Squared 
        Error</a> (MSE) between the predicted image and the real image as the 
        loss function, and used
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio">
        Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)</a> to measure the reconstruction of 
        the image. PSNR is defined as 
        \[
            PSNR = 10 \cdot log_{10}\left(\frac{1}{MSE}\right).
        \]
        The MSE/PSNR graphs for both trainings are shown in Figure 3.

        Part B: Fit a Neural Radiance Field from Multi-view Images
    </h3>
    <p>
        In Part B, I was given 100 images of the same <i>Lego</i> object taken 
        at different viewpoint, along with the camera's coordinates and angles
        when the images were taken. I modeled the 3D <i>Lego</i> object 
        using a Neural Radiance Field, and use it to predict images of the 
        <i>Lego</i> object taken at new perspectives.
    </p>
    <h3>
        B1. Transform 2D Pixel Coordinates to Rays in 3D World Coordinates
    </h3>
    <p>
        To generate a model that represents a 3D object via multi-view calibrated
        images, I need to transform a 2D pixel coordinate in the camera 
        space to a ray in 3D space represented by world space coordinate. The 
        real world correspondences that caused in the RGB color of that pixel
        should be located along that ray. 
    </p>
    <p>
        First, I used the intrinsic matrix \(\mathbf{K}\) to transform 2D pixel
        coordinate to 3D coordinate in camera space. The intrinsic matrix in
        defined as 
        \[
            \begin{align}
            \mathbf{K} = \begin{bmatrix} f_x & 0 & o_x \\ 0 & f_y & o_y \\ 0 & 0 
            & 1 \end{bmatrix} \end{align},
        \]
        where \((f_x, f_y)\) is the camera's focal length, and \((o_x, o_y)\)
        is the camera's principal point, defined as 
        \[
            o_x = \text{image_width} / 2;
        \]
        \[
            o_y = \text{image_height} / 2.
        \]
        The projection from a 2D location \((u, v)\) in pixel coordinate to a 3D 
        point \((x_c, y_c, z_c)\) in the camera coordinate system is denoted as 
        \[
            \begin{align} s \begin{bmatrix} u \\ v \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \mathbf{K}
            \begin{bmatrix} x_c \\ y_c \\ z_c \end{bmatrix} \end{align},
        \]
        in which \(s=z_c\) is the depth of this point along the optical axis.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, I used the rotation matrix 
        \(\mathbf{R}_{3\times3}\) and a translation vector \(\mathbf{t}\) to transform 
        3D camera space coordinate \(\mathbf{X_c} = (x_c, y_c, z_c)\) to 3D world 
        space coordinate \(\mathbf{X_w} = (x_w, y_w, z_w)\), denoted as 
        \[
            \begin{align} \begin{bmatrix} x_c \\ y_c \\ z_c \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = 
            \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{R}_{3\times3} & \mathbf{t} \\ 
            \mathbf{0}_{1\times3} & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_w \\ y_w 
            \\ z_w \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \end{align}.
        \]
    </p>
    <p>
        A ray can be defined by an origin \(\mathbf{r}_o \in R^3\) vector and 
        a direction \(\mathbf{r}_d \in R^3\) vector. I want to know the 
        \(\{\mathbf{r}_o, \mathbf{r}_d\}\) for every pixel \((u, v)\). The origin
        \(\mathbf{r}_o\), or the location of the camera, is 
        \[
            \begin{align} \mathbf{r}_o =
            -\mathbf{R}_{3\times3}^{-1}\mathbf{t} \end{align}.
        \]
        To calculate the ray direction for pixel \((u, v)\), I chose a point 
        along this ray with depth equals 1 \((s=1)\) and find its coordinate in 
        the world space \(\mathbf{X_w} = (x_w, y_w, z_w)\). Then the normalized
        ray direction can be computed by
        \[
            \begin{align} \mathbf{r}_d = \frac{\mathbf{X_w} - 
            \mathbf{r}_o}{||\mathbf{X_w} - \mathbf{r}_o||_2} \end{align}.
        \]
        In this way, I got to compute the corresponding ray

        B2. Sampling along the Ray
    </h3>
    <p>
        Similar to part A, I randomly sampled a batch size of <i>N</i> rays
        from different cameras. I discretized each ray into a number of 3D 
        points. The points are sampled uniformly along each ray between a 
        "near point" and a "far point". During training, I would add a minor 
        perturbation to the points' coordinates. Figure 6 shows the sampled rays 
        (black line) and points (red dot) during each step of training. Their 
        coordinates will be fed to the MLP net as inputs. I reduced the batch 
        size (number of rays sampled) to <i>N</i> = 10 to produce a less crowded 
        figure.

    <h3>
        B3. Volume Rendering
    </h3>
    <p>
        The pixel's color captured by the camera is the combined effort of all 
        objects along the pixel's corresponding ray. The color can be represented
        by the volume rendering equation 
        \[
            \begin{align} C(\mathbf{r})=\int_{t_n}^{t_f} T(t) 
            \sigma(\mathbf{r}(t))\mathbf{c}(\mathbf{r}(t), \mathbf{d}) d t, 
            \text { where } T(t)=\exp \left(-\int_{t_n}^t \sigma(\mathbf{r}(s)) 
            d s\right)\end{align}.
        \]
        The discrete approximation of this equation can be stated as 
        \[
            \begin{align} \hat{C}(\mathbf{r})=\sum_{i=1}^N T_i\left(1-\exp 
            \left(-\sigma_i \delta_i\right)\right) \mathbf{c}_i, \text { where } 
            T_i=\exp\left(-\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} \sigma_j \delta_j\right) \end{align},
        \]
        where \(\textbf{c}_i\) is the RGB color obtained at location \(i\),
        \(T_i\) is the probability of a ray not terminating before sample 
        location \(i\), and \(1 - e^{-\sigma_i \delta_i}\) is the probability 
        of a ray terminating at sample location \(i\), in which \(\sigma_i\) 
        is the color density at location \(i\), and \(\delta_i\) is the step 
        size, or the distance between each sample location.
    </p>
    <p>
        I wish to train a Neural Radiance Field where the rendered color along
        a ray would match the color the camera captured. The smaller the 
        difference between the rendered color and its corresponding true pixel
        color, the better the model fits the 3D object.

        B4. Training a NeRF Net.
    </h3>
    <p>
        I built a larger MLP network to fit a Neural Radiance Field to a 3D
        object. It takes the 3D world coordinates and the normalized ray 
        direction as inputs, and predicts the RGB color of that sample location 
        and its density. Figure 7 shows the architecture of the MLP net.

    <p>
        I trained two MLP models. Each hidden layers in the two MLP net contains
        256 and 1,024 neurons, respectively. The smaller MLP net was trained for 
        2,000 steps while the larger one was trained for 4,000 steps. For each 
        training step, the smaller model randomly samples 10,000 rays with 32 sample 
        locations on each ray, while the larger net randomly samples 5,000 rays 
        with 64 sample locations on each ray. The highest frequency level for 
        PE encoding was set as <i>L</i> = 10 in the smaller net, and <i>L</i> = 20 
        in the larger net. For both models, I used the Adam optimizer with an initial 
        learning rate of 5e-4 for gradient descent. Similar to part A, I chose 
        MSE between the rendered color and the true pixel color as loss function, 
        and used PSNR to measure the reconstruction of the 3D object. The MSE/PSNR 
        graphs for the two approaches are as follows.

        B5. Change Background Color (Bells & Whistles)
    </h3>
    <p>
        To change the background color of the predicted images, I modified the 
        volume rendering equation to
        \[
            \begin{align} \hat{C}(\mathbf{r})=\sum_{i=1}^N T_i\left(1-\exp 
            \left(-\sigma_i \delta_i\right)\right) \mathbf{c}_i + 
            T_{i+1}\mathbf{c}_{back}, \text { where } T_i=\exp
            \left(-\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} \sigma_j \delta_j\right) \end{align}.
        \]
        In this way, when the color densities of all sample locations along a 
        ray are low, and the ray gets to arrive at the background, the
        rendered color would be the background color \(\mathbf{c}_{back}\).
        Figure 11 shows the rendered rotation video with a red, green, blue
        background, respectively.
